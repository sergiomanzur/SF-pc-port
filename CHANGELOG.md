# Changelog

All notable public-test changes are documented here. The project currently uses
pre-release tags rather than a stable semantic-versioning promise.

## 0.1.0-public-test.29 - 2026-08-13

### Rendering and level presentation

- Restored one sequential PS1-style ordering-table submission while retaining
  PGXP depth for widescreen geometry, eliminating the custom chunk stencil,
  split reordering and mid-frame depth clears that exposed interiors through
  exterior walls.
- Extended connected-route residency and rendering with fail-closed texture
  admission and dense retail depth cue, allowing long sight lines without
  submitting an incomplete resource suffix.
- Added optional mission skyboxes with original SCRIM/fog fallback and a
  persistent launcher/INI/CLI toggle.
- Added depth-aware object shadows, fallback smooth normals for legacy GMD
  models and palette-safe minification for indexed textures.

### Fire, particles and lighting

- Added oriented depth-aware fire and smoke volumes, display-rate interpolation
  for retail particles and high-resolution temporal fire frames derived from
  the original sprite families.
- Preloads authored CFIRE resources along the admitted route and resolves
  source-less attached emitters conservatively, so upgraded fire is available
  across missions without converting ordinary explosions.
- Synchronized emissive effects and bounded dynamic lights, including authored
  halo colour, wall-aware light rejection and surface lighting for Girdeux's
  corrected flamethrower arc.
- Reduced duplicate authored fire ownership and kept the original mission-2
  sprite core where its dense retail presentation is required.

### Interface and launcher

- Split the Windows launcher into focused pages, fixed UTF-8 Russian text,
  reliable INI readback and controller layout sizing, and removed the stale
  desktop-resolution hint.
- Restored the ordinary sniper scope's complete 320x160 black mask on all four
  sides; ordinary HUD elements now hide inside rifle optics and return on the
  native release edge without animation.
- Detached retail information messages from the normal HUD pass so mission
  failure/death text remains visible above letterbox framing.
- Added a presentation-only C4 callout target while preserving retail mission
  triggers, collision and pickup state.

### Validation

- Windows x64 PsyCross Release build completed successfully.
- Full Release CTest suite and release archive audits completed successfully.
- The release ZIP includes all runtime mission skyboxes and excludes game
  images, saves, settings, logs, debug symbols and developer artifacts.
- The interactive game was not launched during automated validation.

## 0.1.0-public-test.28 - 2026-08-07

### Controller stability and configuration

- Added three persistent stick layouts: character-left/camera-right,
  character-right/camera-left and the original one-stick scheme.
- Unified stick-layout and vibration settings between the launcher and the
  in-game controller menu, including reliable retry after a settings-write
  failure.
- Made both sticks navigate title and save menus on either axis, with
  connection baselining and stronger hysteresis to reject DualSense drift.
- Applied a calibrated camera deadzone in gameplay and first-person aiming
  while preserving proportional movement outside the deadzone.
- Fixed native rumble delivery and added working vibration toggles and preview
  feedback to the launcher and in-game options.

### Menu prompts

- Replaced hard-coded keyboard instructions on the load, difficulty and Agent
  warning screens with framed prompts for the active input device.
- Corrected controller-family labels so the displayed confirm and back buttons
  match the fixed retail menu controls.

### Kazakhstan rendering

- Removed exact helper-shell duplicates over authored rockets and cisterns in
  the base exterior, bunker and escape missions, eliminating z-fighting and
  leaked collision-tile textures without changing gameplay or collision.

### Validation

- Windows x64 PsyCross Release build completed successfully.
- Full PsyCross CTest suite passed: 41/41, including supported-ROM probes.
- Temporary renderer probes and diagnostic hotkeys were removed before
  packaging; the interactive game was not launched during automated checks.

## 0.1.0-public-test.27 - 2026-08-07

### Controller navigation

- Increased the title-menu analog deadzone to reject ordinary DualSense stick
  drift without changing gameplay aiming or movement sensitivity.
- Resolved opposing-axis priority so the dominant intentional stick movement
  controls title and campaign-save navigation.

### Agent mission HUD

- Removed the redundant Girdeux `FUEL TANK` meter from Freedom Memorial while
  preserving the bomb-detonation budget and the tank weak-point mechanics.

### Validation

- Windows x64 PsyCross Release build completed successfully.
- Full PsyCross CTest suite passed: 41/41, including supported-ROM probes.

## 0.1.0-public-test.26 - 2026-08-07

### Controller support

- Added selectable Automatic, XInput, DirectInput and Raw Input controller
  backends with stable hot-plug handling and physical-device snapshots.
- Restored retail vibration commands with safe motor shutdown on pause, focus
  loss, disconnect, restart and scene teardown.
- Added physical gamepad rebinding to the launcher and pause menu, including
  controller-family button labels, conflict swaps and disconnect-safe capture.
- Unified both rebind interfaces on one canonical action catalog, validation
  path and `[ControllerBindings]` section in `launcher.ini`.
- Made Apply/Resume persist the active layout while Cancel, window close and
  capture cancellation leave the committed layout unchanged. Failed writes
  remain live in memory and retry across Return to Title.
- Switched service-message prompts between keyboard/mouse and the active
  controller family without changing the underlying retail actions.

### Aiming and input timing

- Restored right-stick movement in first-person aiming and calibrated it for a
  faster response while retaining proportional fine control.
- Kept native-rate controller samples current between 20 Hz retail updates so
  held look input and short button edges are not dropped.

### Validation

- Windows x64 PsyCross Release build completed successfully.
- Full PsyCross CTest suite passed: 41/41, including supported-ROM probes.

## 0.1.0-public-test.25 - 2026-08-06

### Mission presentation and retries

- Completed localized status messages against their canonical source text and
  made their backdrops follow the rendered width in both supported languages.
- Kept the final Mission Failed frame visible long enough to complete its text
  and restored deterministic world, overlay and fade ordering after retries.
- Added a framed localized Select Difficulty heading in both supported locales.
- Preserved checkpoint weapons and ammunition across death and mission-failure
  retries while leaving a full mission restart authoritative.

### World presentation

- Restored distant authored fire in the second mission with stable prefetch,
  gradual reveal, fog integration and texture residency.
- Primed active and prefetched world chunks after checkpoint restores to avoid
  exposed interiors and layered geometry during the first rebuilt frame.
- Removed the redundant Agent-only bomb-technician health and suspicion meters;
  the original retail Danger indicator and remaining Agent meters are unchanged.

### Validation

- Windows x64 PsyCross Release build completed successfully.
- Full PsyCross CTest suite passed: 40/40, including supported-ROM probes.

## 0.1.0-public-test.24 - 2026-08-06

### Difficulty and saves

- Added a localized confirmation screen before starting a new Agent campaign;
  it identifies Agent as a PC-version addition and briefly explains its higher
  enemy threat and stricter mission conditions.

- Added a localized three-mode New Game selector: **Normal**, **Hard Mode** and
  **Agent** (`Оригинал`, `Высокая сложность`, `Агент`).
- Moved retail Hard Mode out of the cheat list and made it a persistent campaign
  choice. Agent retains the retail hard-mode behavior, adds 25% incoming player
  damage, strengthens enemy aim and tracks a fresh target point at medium range.
- Agent now replaces the recurring Hard notice with its own localized start
  message. On 20% of new hostile SVD/sniper engagements, the original localized
  Head Shot leader appears above Gabe. After a one-second grace period, the
  warned enemy's next ballistic hit is a guaranteed one-shot kill.
- Agent enemies now alert immediately at twice the retail grenade distance.
  Unsafe first route edges toward the grenade are rejected while collision,
  path following and locomotion remain guest-owned.
- Extended campaign saves to V5 with a per-slot difficulty marker; V1-V4 saves
  remain compatible and migrate to Normal.

### Agent mission rules

- Added exact mission HUD meters for Destroyed Subway, Main Subway Line,
  Freedom Memorial, Expo Center Reception and Expo Center Dinorama.
- Added validated actor-specific overrides: Kravitch carries an ITHACA-37 and
  uses shorter retail firing pauses with post-shot route changes; Aramov's
  Main Subway Line movement is 25% faster; Marcos uses fragmentation grenades
  at a faster cadence; Gabrek carries an M-16 and fragmentation grenades;
  three exact Stronghold lower-level chapel guards carry shotguns; and active
  fragmentation-equipped PHARCOM elite guards use a faster grenade cadence.
- Set the Washington Park Agent timer to 15 minutes and deduct 30 seconds for
  each damaging player hit on an exact CBDC bomb-technician actor.
- Added Freedom Memorial's 100% bomb-detonation budget: shotgun hits add 50%,
  .45 hits 40%, M-16 hits 10%, 9 mm/rifle hits 2%, and an M-79 hit or thrown
  grenade fills the budget; taser and flashlight events do not affect it.
- Set Base Escape to 2:24 and Warehouse 76 to 12 minutes, including the
  Warehouse objective text. In Tunnel Blackout, an active flashlight extends
  Agent enemy target memory from 80 to 100 game frames.

## 0.1.0-public-test.23 - 2026-08-04

### Graphics

- Added palette-aware, atlas-clamped mip reconstruction with trilinear and
  mipmapped anisotropic filtering for distant world textures.
- Upgraded official SMAA 1x to the Ultra preset with combined colour/depth
  edges, and made it a mutually exclusive alternative to MSAA. The scene-only
  pass remains before projected overlays, HUD, optics and letterbox.

### Combat and aiming

- Made grenade input reliable across the retail readiness gate.
- Unified first-person and auto-lock reticles under one rendering path, with
  distance-based sizing, a smaller calibrated frame and faster display-rate
  scale response while retaining soft positional follow.
- Restored reliable first-person bullet impacts, surface-aligned short-lived
  decals and PS1-style per-vertex wound colouring instead of whole-model flash.

### Presentation

- Preserved the authored night-vision filter across mission-specific tunnel
  environments.
- Kept moving-light, flashlight and impact presentation synchronized with the
  current display rate without changing the original 20 Hz game simulation.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for retail aim-ray depth, reticle ownership and
  near/far reticle geometry.

## 0.1.0-public-test.22 - 2026-08-03

### Lighting

- Restored retail-matrix flashlight and searchlight illumination on dark floors,
  walls and ceilings without surface-normal rejection.
- Updated moving `SPOTLT` illumination at the display rate while preserving
  the original 20 Hz game logic.
- Kept the original vertex-light presentation without fake cone geometry.

## 0.1.0-public-test.21 - 2026-08-03

### Lighting

- Restored the flashlight's intended brightness by removing the duplicate CAVE2
  `/8` pre-light attenuation.
- Restored moving surface light spots for `SPOTLT` mission sources.

## 0.1.0-public-test.20 - 2026-08-03

### Lighting and presentation

- Restored PS1 list-driven vertex lighting for the player flashlight and moving
  `SPOTLT` sources, including gameplay-critical surface light spots.
- Interpolated light transforms at the display refresh rate while preserving
  authoritative 20 Hz game logic.
- Removed the non-retail volumetric flashlight cone and duplicated native
  directional fill.
- Reset viral-detector presentation immediately after aiming ends, preventing
  scanner tint from masking normal lighting.

## 0.1.0-public-test.19 - 2026-08-03

### Presentation

- Viral-detector actors and their attached weapons now use an opaque
  flat-orange silhouette in normal world depth, while level geometry, boxes
  and GMD retain the orange semitransparent scanner material.

## 0.1.0-public-test.18 - 2026-08-02

### Presentation

- Restored the PS1 HUD/letterbox state machine and synchronized it with radio
  dialogue, fast skipping and the authored viewport transition.
- Smoothed HUD and letterbox motion at the display refresh rate while retaining
  authoritative 20 Hz game logic; presentation now settles 15% faster.
- Reworked SVD night vision to preserve fog and scene gradients, restore scope
  markings and trails, and rotate billboard sprites while aiming.
- Removed the alternating framebuffer-page flicker and the lingering green
  filter after leaving the SVD scope.
- Restored the viral detector's original first-person sight, pulsing marker and
  exact under-128 object pairing; level geometry, boxes and GMD now receive the
  retail orange semitransparent material, while enemy models remain
  unchanged.
- Restored the sniper scope's specialized PS1 STP/semitransparency blend for
  `SCOPED.TIM`, recovering its dark gradient and the dark regions around the
  crosshair.
- Hid the presentation FPS counter by default and added an F6 display toggle.

### Media and localization

- Reduced gameplay-FMV startup latency, restored gameplay-FMV fades and fixed
  mission-briefing audio-clock startup failures.
- Renamed the launcher language option from `Русский (ViT Co.)` to `Русский`.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for viewport normalization, display-rate UI
  interpolation, radio state and presentation timing.

## 0.1.0-public-test.17 - 2026-08-02

- Release tag alias for Public Test 16. Both local tags resolve to source
  revision `7519dc0`; there is no source delta between them.

## 0.1.0-public-test.16 - 2026-08-02

### Optics and validation

- Restored the retail SVD live silhouettes and three 20 Hz pose-history echoes.
- Rebuilt the virus scanner around the authored target slot and x-ray marker.
- Isolated optic capture from the visible PGXP stream and reserved packet
  storage for actor/model changes within a guest frame.
- Passed the documented MSVC, PsyCross, VRAM/PGXP and package validation gates.

Full notes: [Public Test 16](docs/releases/0.1.0-public-test.16.md).

## 0.1.0-public-test.15 - 2026-07-31

### Lighting and distance presentation

- Restored PS1-authored darkness on static terrain by excluding persistent
  reconstructed native lights from baked world geometry while preserving
  transient muzzle flashes, fire, explosions and the player flashlight.
- Extended native presentation by one portal-visibility ring and hid the extra
  geometry behind the retail depth cue plus a 0.60-second appearance fade.
  The lookahead is presentation-only and cannot alter collision, active
  objects, guest state or retail always-resident models.
- Kept GLIT/YLIT lamp halos and emissive billboards full-bright while allowing
  physical lamp fixtures to retain appropriate scene lighting and fog.

### Effects and presentation

- Reconciled original guest SPFX packets with native fallback effects by exact
  pool identity, preventing duplicated, oversized or distance-dependent fire,
  smoke and explosion sprites.
- Reworked HUD and letterbox transitions into an ordered fade sequence driven
  by the original viewport/radio state, avoiding false activation from target
  tracking, shots and streaming boundaries.
- Preserved authored static vertex colours in dynamically lit areas instead of
  washing dark mission regions toward white.

### Validation

- Restored and enforced the retail active/resident world-model contract for all
  20 missions after separating render lookahead from authoritative gameplay.
- Added regression coverage for dynamic-light policy, depth cue, chunk
  appearance, SPFX ownership, HUD/letterbox transitions and R3000 state.
- Validated complete MSVC and PsyCross Release suites, all supported-ROM probes,
  package manifest, internal hashes and forbidden-file rules.

### Release artifact

- File: `SyphonFilterPC-0.1.0-public-test.15-win64.zip`
- Checksum: supplied in the accompanying `.zip.sha256` file.
- Supported disc: *Syphon Filter* USA v1.1 (`SCUS-94240`), BIN/CUE.

## 0.1.0-public-test.14 - 2026-07-30

### Mission flow and localization

- Restored the authored mission-failure screen for scripted objective and
  parameter failures, including the original fade, type-on text and a single
  reliable restart path instead of an unlabelled black screen.
- Added complete Russian translations for mission-parameter and
  mission-objective failure messages, including partial type-on states, and
  synchronized the editable localization review documents.
- Polished mission startup with a calmer prompt reveal, a short transition into
  gameplay and correct composition of native and retail fades.

### Presentation and performance

- Corrected compact pickup sizing and made world callouts reveal and fade at a
  consistent speed from 30 through 240 presentation FPS.
- Added a smoothed presentation FPS and frame-time counter for diagnosing real
  host rendering performance independently of the original 20 Hz game logic.
- Split the monolithic PsyCross scene viewer into focused runtime, render,
  world, model, texture, HUD, pause, effects, save and presentation modules.
- Reduced repeated scene allocations and calculations while preserving the
  existing renderer, audio, texture-residency and Surface Picker release gates.

### Validation

- Extended regression coverage for mission failure, localization, HUD, audio
  output and R3000 runtime behavior.
- Validated complete MSVC and PsyCross Release suites, supported-ROM probes,
  package manifest, internal hashes and forbidden-file rules.

### Release artifact

- File: `SyphonFilterPC-0.1.0-public-test.14-win64.zip`
- Checksum: supplied in the accompanying `.zip.sha256` file.
- Supported disc: *Syphon Filter* USA v1.1 (`SCUS-94240`), BIN/CUE.

## 0.1.0-public-test.13 - 2026-07-30

### Campaign and controls

- Restored the post-mission save flow, occupied-slot overwrite confirmation,
  FMV handoff and next-mission transition. Replaying an unlocked mission no
  longer lowers the durable campaign frontier.
- Made manual first-person aim atomically release a latched auto-target,
  preserve Gabe's final sight heading and support the retail crouch transition
  without moving his collision root.
- Corrected diagonal movement, danger-meter release and the lifecycle of
  enemy weapon drops across high-rate presentation frames.

### Rendering and presentation

- Restored the original pre-rendered MENU.HOG weapon artwork for every pause
  menu entry instead of reusing HUD/pickup sprites.
- Kept all three Georgia Street objective bombs alive across subway DAT
  boundaries and resolved their BOMB-family materials from resident SPFX.
- Rebuilt and published the complete mutable SCRIM copy ring atomically, so
  train and sign polygons no longer sample different texture-copy phases after
  a room transition.
- Recreated the virus scanner's amber X-ray pass, infected-body reveal and
  retail status-message routing for missions 15 and 16.
- Extended geometry-driven character shadows to held weapons, stabilized light
  selection and surface transitions, and excluded emissive lamp/glow effects
  from ordinary scene darkening.
- Added distance-based camera fading for Gabe, restored reticle and world-label
  reveal animation, and limited letterbox bars to authored mission openings.
- Cached local scene lighting and dynamic-light input per 20 Hz guest tick to
  avoid repeating unchanged renderer work at 60–240 FPS.

### Audio and localization

- Reworked the native audio frame clock and VAB one-shot decoding to reduce
  latency, underruns, skipped samples and restart artifacts at high frame rates.
- Restored Gabe's voice preview when changing voice volume.
- Kept original English optic captions for the sniper, night-vision rifle and
  virus scanner under the Russian text pack; corrected gameplay-message
  routing and prevented Cyrillic mission text from leaking into English UI.

### Validation

- Added regression coverage for campaign overwrite flow, mission replay,
  manual-aim ownership, scanner bridge state, bomb residency, texture-bank
  provenance, weapon art, dropped-item stability, audio decoding and camera
  fade policy.
- Validated complete MSVC and PsyCross Release suites, supported-ROM probes,
  package manifest, internal hashes and forbidden-file rules.

### Release artifact

- File: `SyphonFilterPC-0.1.0-public-test.13-win64.zip`
- Checksum: supplied in the accompanying `.zip.sha256` file.
- Supported disc: *Syphon Filter* USA v1.1 (`SCUS-94240`), BIN/CUE.

## 0.1.0-public-test.12 - 2026-07-28

### Gameplay and input

- Froze Gabe's collision root for the complete first-person aim hold at both
  the host-input admission layer and the low-level player controller. A
  simultaneous aim plus WASD edge can no longer enter collision resolution or
  reuse an unresolved transition height.
- Isolated first-person entry from rolls, recovery actions and active radio
  conversations, with release-to-rearm semantics after a rejected transition.
- Kept Circle as an optic zoom command only for the sniper and night-vision
  rifles instead of forwarding it into incompatible grenade/roll paths.

### Rendering and localization

- Applied local scene lighting to ordinary GMD trigger props and supplied an
  HMD fallback when a switch/control object has no valid retail back-color.
- Regenerated the Russian Industria font sheets with bilinear-safe cell
  gutters, corrected vertical metrics and a small briefing-layout guard so
  glyphs remain inside the original interface frame.

### Release artifact

- File: `SyphonFilterPC-0.1.0-public-test.12-win64.zip`
- Checksum: supplied in the accompanying `.zip.sha256` file.
- Supported disc: *Syphon Filter* USA v1.1 (`SCUS-94240`), BIN/CUE.

## 0.1.0-public-test.11 - 2026-07-28

### Rendering

- Removed the experimental screen-space contact-shadow/SSAO pass completely,
  including its shaders, intermediate framebuffers, launcher option and command
  line switches.
- Retained the PT10 renderer hot-path optimizations and the existing
  geometry-driven dynamic character shadows.

### Release artifact

- File: `SyphonFilterPC-0.1.0-public-test.11-win64.zip`
- Checksum: supplied in the accompanying `.zip.sha256` file.
- Supported disc: *Syphon Filter* USA v1.1 (`SCUS-94240`), BIN/CUE.

## 0.1.0-public-test.10 - 2026-07-28

### Rendering

- Added optional half-resolution SSAO with reversed-Z reconstruction and a
  depth-aware bilateral blur. The effect is composited before transparent
  effects and HUD rendering, so interface art remains clean.
- Removed synchronous OpenGL state queries from the frame, resolve and SSAO
  paths by making renderer-owned state explicit and cached.
- Replaced full VRAM texture refreshes with coalesced dirty-row uploads and
  converted native framebuffer readback directly into guest VRAM.
- Reused dynamic-light, shadow, HUD, callout and weapon-effect scratch storage
  across presentation frames, and moved expensive primitive-capacity planning
  to the original 20 Hz guest tick.
- Reduced SSAO sampling and blur bandwidth while retaining depth-aware edges.

### Release artifact

- File: `SyphonFilterPC-0.1.0-public-test.10-win64.zip`
- Checksum: supplied in the accompanying `.zip.sha256` file.
- Supported disc: *Syphon Filter* USA v1.1 (`SCUS-94240`), BIN/CUE.

## 0.1.0-public-test.9 - 2026-07-28

### Gameplay and input

- Separated first-person WASD locomotion from mouse/right-stick sight input;
  stale guest PAD axes and chase-mode target anchors can no longer kick the
  first-person reticle.
- Smoothed high-refresh first-person camera presentation, lateral movement and
  weapon-switch animation while retaining the original 20 Hz game simulation.
- Restored consistent typewriter animation, wrapping and backdrop bounds for
  gameplay notifications in both English and Russian.

### Rendering

- Stabilized geometry-driven character shadows across ledges, walls and scenes
  with multiple light sources while reducing redundant projection work.
- Corrected depth classification and opaque/transparent submission ordering for
  glass and other translucent world polygons without applying world depth to
  screen-space UI.
- Removed the Surface Picker and its diagnostic payload from public builds.

### Localization and presentation

- Kept original English scope captions for sniper and night-vision weapons and
  hardened partial typewriter packets against accidental Cyrillic remapping.
- Extended regression coverage for first-person input, reticles, message reveal,
  transparent depth and shadow stability.

### Release artifact

- File: `SyphonFilterPC-0.1.0-public-test.9-win64.zip`
- Checksum: supplied in the accompanying `.zip.sha256` file.
- Supported disc: *Syphon Filter* USA v1.1 (`SCUS-94240`), BIN/CUE.

## 0.1.0-public-test.8 - 2026-07-27

### Gameplay and presentation

- Restored the documented USA/PAL retail cheat chords, centralized their
  persistent runtime state and added an original-style **Options > Cheats**
  page; launcher-side mission and cheat controls were removed.
- Corrected the Russian `Ш/Щ/ш/щ` middle stems in the generated Industria atlas
  and retained canonical English labels in sniper/night-vision scopes.
- Reworked Russian map-objective wrapping and replaced frame-rate-dependent
  flashing with a synchronized low-contrast objective glow.
- Protected the final campaign stream from an inherited input edge so the
  credits and post-credits sequence play to completion.
- Added dynamic scene lights and geometry-driven shadows for Gabe, allies and
  enemies, including stable floor/wall projection and bounded translucency.
- Restored original English sniper/night-vision scope labels and resolved every
  button token against the active keyboard, mouse or gamepad binding.
- Isolated mission-menu overrides to the selected locale so Russian objective
  records can never replace the original English guest strings.

### Rendering and streaming

- Reworked VRAM texture aliases around explicit scene generations and complete
  page/CLUT identity, preventing stale room textures and disappearing actors.
- Corrected mission texture-bank validation and retail SCRIM copy semantics
  across streamed segments without weakening invalid-state guards.
- Added an opt-in Surface Picker that highlights one submitted surface and
  writes a complete diagnostic dump on request.

### Audio and timing

- Separated the 120 Hz retail SPU clock from presentation rates up to 240 FPS,
  and made synchronous CD/DMA completion advance devices without generating
  future audio.
- Rebuilt OpenAL buffering and underrun recovery around one bounded monotonic
  timeline, avoiding stale replay, dropped samples and accumulated latency.

### Architecture

- Moved retail cheat definitions, chord detection and state into a dedicated
  game module shared by the pause menu and gameplay runtime.
- Kept cheat state alive across mission transitions and returns to the title
  screen, with one activation path for both original button codes and menu
  switches.
- Split dynamic lighting, scope-text policy, mission texture ownership and
  Surface Picker diagnostics into testable modules with regression coverage.
- Updated headless gameplay probes to advance the same independently driven
  120 Hz hardware/audio clock as the real frontend, without double-clocking the
  production runtime.

### Release artifact

- File: `SyphonFilterPC-0.1.0-public-test.8-win64.zip`
- Checksum: supplied in the accompanying `.zip.sha256` file.
- Supported disc: *Syphon Filter* USA v1.1 (`SCUS-94240`), BIN/CUE.

## 0.1.0-public-test.7 - 2026-07-25

### Russian localization

- Added the complete text-only Russian language pack for all 20 missions,
  including proofread menus, objectives, parameters, briefings, gameplay
  messages, weapon descriptions and baked map/title labels.
- Rebuilt the ViT-compatible font sheets as a unified 2x Industria-style atlas
  while preserving the retail byte map, advances and logical menu geometry.
- Fixed incomplete or mismatched mission briefings, missing weapon descriptions,
  weapon specification tables and every observed spelling/case variant of the
  gas-grenade pickup message.
- Kept speech, music and FMV on the original USA v1.1 disc; the pack changes
  presentation text only.

### Presentation and runtime

- Finished the original two-page Weapons presentation and restored complete
  descriptions, ammunition data and the four authored specifications.
- Corrected text flow, pagination and placement across briefing, objective,
  parameter, map, weapon and options pages for both supported languages.
- Added working vertical synchronization and a high-resolution frame limiter,
  and removed the guest CPU-overclock workaround from normal gameplay timing.
- Replaced restart-prone gameplay audio queues with a bounded continuous
  callback stream, stock-rate SPU scheduling and deterministic transition reset.
- Corrected scene ordering and depth behavior for translucent polygons, pickups,
  grenade sprites and transient effects without bypassing authored occlusion.
- Preserved mission completion/save flow, campaign unlock progress and
  restart-safe destructible state.

### Launcher and architecture

- Corrected launcher layout and Unicode language labels, and exposed the new
  Russian text pack through the persistent language selector.
- Split file I/O, localization, pause-menu data, retail map projection, VRAM,
  runtime guards and native font upload into explicit modules with automated
  architecture checks.
- Updated the public packager to require and include the complete `locales`
  directory while continuing to reject disc images, saves, logs, cheats and
  developer binaries.

## 0.1.0-public-test.6 - 2026-07-24

### Stability

- Fixed a renderer/UI bridge fault in the PHARCOM warehouse missions when the
  retail streamer recycled an active world's relocated vertex-color payload.
- Kept guest world visibility and geometry authoritative while treating the
  transient per-vertex lighting payload as an optional presentation cache.
- Extended the headless retail environment probe and validated all three
  warehouse missions past the reported failure frame.

### Release artifact

- File: `SyphonFilterPC-0.1.0-public-test.6-win64.zip`
- Checksum: supplied in the accompanying `.zip.sha256` file.

## 0.1.0-public-test.5 - 2026-07-24

### Launcher and distribution

- Replaced the command-script bootstrap with an integrated Windows launcher.
- Added first-run CUE selection, persistent graphics/input settings and styled
  auxiliary dialogs.
- Added an English **DOSSIERS** button and a four-page bonus gallery.
- Added a new multi-resolution launcher icon featuring Gabe Logan.
- Added a controlled release packager with clean-install checks, dependency
  licenses, per-file SHA-256 sums and an archive checksum.
- Ensured public packages contain no save data, settings, game images or
  `syphon_filter_cheats` marker.

### Rendering and graphics

- Applied the selected resolution to the internal color/depth render targets,
  not only the UI.
- Added independent anisotropic filtering and seam-safe bilinear texture
  filtering that clamps PS1 atlas tiles without bleeding across their edges.
- Added selectable MSAA and original/adaptive aspect modes.
- Improved FMV presentation and removed the additional dithering pass.
- Reworked weapon muzzle flashes with a smaller textured star shape and reliable
  player/enemy shot triggering.
- Corrected first-person muzzle-flash rules: the player's own flash is hidden
  while enemy flashes remain visible.
- Restored depth occlusion for pickups, grenade sprites, blood, sparks and other
  transient effects.
- Fixed scene lighting on weapon crates and multiple level texture/model mapping
  errors, including the Kazakhstan gas tank case.
- Removed the development FPS counter from the game image.

### Gameplay presentation

- Restored every documented pause-menu retail cheat and its original button
  context, including PAL aliases, infinite ammunition, one-shot kills, weak
  enemies, stage select and the Georgia Street theater.
- Added the original-style **Options > Cheats** page with synchronized switches
  for all five restored modes.
- Removed mission selection and cheat controls from the launcher permanently;
  `syphon_filter_cheats` now activates persistent retail cheats directly.

- Rebuilt the pause map presentation around the original PS1 layout, including
  map layers, current Gabe position and active-objective indicators.
- Reworked Objectives, Parameters, Options and Weapons pages, including the
  three weapon-stat bars and full-information panel backgrounds.
- Muted world audio while the pause menu is open while retaining menu sounds;
  restored audio levels on close.
- Fixed campaign mission unlock progression and preserved the highest unlocked
  mission when replaying an earlier stage.
- Gated unrestricted mission selection behind an explicit local
  `syphon_filter_cheats` marker.
- Restored the grenade sprite, ballistic flight path and scene occlusion for
  player and enemy throws.
- Fixed disappearing held weapons and bomb/destructible models during missions.
- Restored window, glass-panel and stained-glass destruction into visible shards.
- Fixed destructible state restoration after both manual restart and
  failure-triggered mission restart.
